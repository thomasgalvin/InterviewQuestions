 * This class finds the first 100 prime numbers.

 * A prime number is a number evenly divisible only by 1 and itself. 
 * 
 * By definition, neither 0 nor 1 are prime.
 * 
 * For example, 7 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 7, 
 * but 33 is not prime, because it can be evenly divided by 3.
